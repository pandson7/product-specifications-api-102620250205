# Product Specifications API - Cost Analysis Executive Summary

## Key Findings

### Monthly Cost Estimates (Current Architecture)
- **Low Usage (1M requests)**: $3.69/month
- **Medium Usage (5M requests)**: $25.49/month  
- **High Usage (25M requests)**: $167.41/month

### Cost Distribution by Service
- **API Gateway**: 95% of costs in low usage, 52% in high usage
- **DynamoDB**: Becomes dominant cost driver at scale (36% in high usage)
- **Lambda**: Minimal costs due to generous free tier

### Optimization Opportunities
- **Switch to HTTP API**: 71% reduction in API Gateway costs
- **Implement Caching**: 30-50% reduction in backend calls
- **Right-size Lambda**: 20-50% compute cost savings

### Optimized Cost Projections
- **Low Usage**: $3.69 → $1.19 (68% savings)
- **Medium Usage**: $25.49 → $12.99 (49% savings)
- **High Usage**: $167.41 → $104.91 (37% savings)

## Recommendations Priority

### High Priority (Immediate Implementation)
1. Replace REST API with HTTP API Gateway
2. Implement response caching for product data
3. Monitor and optimize Lambda memory allocation

### Medium Priority (Next 3 months)
1. Set up cost monitoring and alerting
2. Optimize DynamoDB query patterns
3. Consider reserved capacity for predictable workloads

### Low Priority (Long-term)
1. Implement data archiving strategy
2. Evaluate multi-region deployment costs
3. Consider Lambda Provisioned Concurrency for high-traffic scenarios
