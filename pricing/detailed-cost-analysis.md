# Product Specifications API - Detailed AWS Cost Analysis

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive cost analysis for the Product Specifications API, a serverless solution built on AWS using API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB. The analysis includes three usage scenarios (Low, Medium, High) with detailed cost breakdowns and optimization recommendations.

## Architecture Overview

The Product Specifications API consists of:
- **API Gateway**: HTTP REST API for request routing
- **AWS Lambda**: Two functions (getProduct, listProducts) with Node.js 18.x runtime
- **DynamoDB**: On-demand table with Global Secondary Indexes for category and brand filtering

## Cost Analysis by Usage Scenario

### Low Usage Scenario (Startup/Development)
- **API Requests**: 1M requests/month
- **Lambda Invocations**: 1M invocations/month
- **DynamoDB Operations**: 1M reads, 100K writes
- **Data Storage**: 10GB

### Medium Usage Scenario (Growing Business)
- **API Requests**: 5M requests/month
- **Lambda Invocations**: 5M invocations/month
- **DynamoDB Operations**: 5M reads, 500K writes
- **Data Storage**: 50GB

### High Usage Scenario (Enterprise Scale)
- **API Requests**: 25M requests/month
- **Lambda Invocations**: 25M invocations/month
- **DynamoDB Operations**: 25M reads, 2.5M writes
- **Data Storage**: 250GB

## Detailed Cost Breakdown

### 1. Amazon API Gateway (REST API)

**Pricing**: $3.50 per million requests (first 333M requests/month)

| Scenario | Requests/Month | Monthly Cost | Calculation |
|----------|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| Low      | 1M             | $3.50        | $3.50 × 1 = $3.50 |
| Medium   | 5M             | $17.50       | $3.50 × 5 = $17.50 |
| High     | 25M            | $87.50       | $3.50 × 25 = $87.50 |

**Cost Optimization**: Consider HTTP API instead of REST API to reduce costs by ~70% ($1.00 per million requests)

### 2. AWS Lambda

**Configuration**:
- Memory: 256MB (0.25GB)
- Average Duration: 200ms (0.2 seconds)
- Runtime: Node.js 18.x

**Pricing**:
- Requests: $0.20 per 1M requests
- Compute: $0.0000166667 per GB-second (first 6B GB-seconds)

**Free Tier**: 1M requests/month + 400,000 GB-seconds/month

| Scenario | Requests | GB-Seconds | Request Cost | Compute Cost | Total Cost |
|----------|----------|------------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| Low      | 1M       | 50,000     | $0.00*       | $0.00*       | $0.00      |
| Medium   | 5M       | 250,000    | $0.80        | $0.00*       | $0.80      |
| High     | 25M      | 1,250,000  | $4.80        | $14.17       | $18.97     |

*Covered by free tier

**Calculations**:
- GB-Seconds = Requests × Duration × Memory = Requests × 0.2s × 0.25GB
- Low: 1M × 0.2 × 0.25 = 50,000 GB-seconds (within free tier)
- Medium: 5M × 0.2 × 0.25 = 250,000 GB-seconds (within free tier for compute)
- High: 25M × 0.2 × 0.25 = 1,250,000 GB-seconds

### 3. Amazon DynamoDB (On-Demand)

**Pricing**:
- Read Request Units: $0.125 per million RRUs
- Write Request Units: $0.625 per million WRUs
- Storage: $0.25 per GB-month (first 25GB free)

**Free Tier**: 25GB storage/month

| Scenario | Reads | Writes | Storage | Read Cost | Write Cost | Storage Cost | Total Cost |
|----------|-------|--------|---------|-----------|------------|--------------|------------|
| Low      | 1M    | 100K   | 10GB    | $0.125    | $0.0625    | $0.00*       | $0.19      |
| Medium   | 5M    | 500K   | 50GB    | $0.625    | $0.3125    | $6.25        | $7.19      |
| High     | 25M   | 2.5M   | 250GB   | $3.125    | $1.5625    | $56.25       | $60.94     |

*First 25GB covered by free tier

**Storage Cost Calculations**:
- Low: (10GB - 25GB free) = $0 (within free tier)
- Medium: (50GB - 25GB free) × $0.25 = 25GB × $0.25 = $6.25
- High: (250GB - 25GB free) × $0.25 = 225GB × $0.25 = $56.25

## Total Monthly Cost Summary

| Scenario | API Gateway | Lambda | DynamoDB | **Total** |
|----------|-------------|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Low**  | $3.50       | $0.00  | $0.19    | **$3.69** |
| **Medium** | $17.50    | $0.80  | $7.19    | **$25.49** |
| **High** | $87.50      | $18.97 | $60.94   | **$167.41** |

## Cost Optimization Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Potential 40-70% Cost Reduction)

1. **Switch to HTTP API**: Replace REST API with HTTP API
   - Savings: $2.50 per million requests (71% reduction)
   - Low scenario: $3.50 → $1.00 (saves $2.50/month)
   - High scenario: $87.50 → $25.00 (saves $62.50/month)

2. **Implement API Gateway Caching**: Cache frequently accessed products
   - Cost: $0.02/hour for 0.5GB cache = $14.40/month
   - Potential savings: 30-50% reduction in Lambda invocations and DynamoDB reads

3. **Optimize Lambda Memory**: Right-size memory allocation
   - Test with 128MB or 512MB based on actual performance needs
   - Potential savings: 20-50% on compute costs

### Best Practices for Long-term Optimization

1. **DynamoDB Reserved Capacity**: For predictable workloads
   - Potential savings: Up to 76% on provisioned capacity

2. **Lambda Provisioned Concurrency**: Only for consistent high-traffic patterns
   - Cost: $0.0000041667 per GB-second
   - Use only when cold start latency is critical

3. **Monitoring and Alerting**:
   - Set up CloudWatch alarms for cost thresholds
   - Monitor unused capacity and optimize accordingly

4. **Data Access Patterns**:
   - Use eventually consistent reads where possible (50% cost reduction)
   - Implement efficient pagination to reduce data transfer

| Month | Low Scenario | Medium Scenario | High Scenario |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|
| 1     | $1.19        | $12.99          | $104.91       |
| 6     | $2.95        | $32.18          | $259.84       |
| 12    | $10.83       | $118.14         | $954.79       |

## Risk Factors and Considerations

### Cost Risks

- **Data growth**: Storage costs scale linearly with data volume

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement rate limiting and throttling
- Use DynamoDB's burst capacity wisely
- Monitor and optimize query patterns
- Consider data archiving strategies for old products
