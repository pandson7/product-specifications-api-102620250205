# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Product Specifications API provides a RESTful interface for accessing product information stored in a flexible JSON format. The system enables retrieval of product specifications including name, category, brand, and other attributes from a DynamoDB database. The API supports flexible schema to accommodate varying product types and their unique specifications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Product Data Retrieval
**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to retrieve product specifications by product ID, so that I can access detailed product information for my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a valid product ID is provided in the API request THE SYSTEM SHALL return the complete product specification in JSON format
2. WHEN an invalid or non-existent product ID is provided THE SYSTEM SHALL return a 404 error with appropriate error message
3. WHEN the API request is malformed THE SYSTEM SHALL return a 400 error with validation details

### Requirement 2: Product Listing
**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to retrieve a list of all available products, so that I can browse and discover products in the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a request is made to list all products THE SYSTEM SHALL return a paginated list of products with basic information
2. WHEN pagination parameters are provided THE SYSTEM SHALL return results according to the specified page size and offset
3. WHEN no products exist THE SYSTEM SHALL return an empty array with appropriate metadata

### Requirement 3: Product Filtering by Category
**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to filter products by category, so that I can retrieve products relevant to specific categories.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a category filter is applied THE SYSTEM SHALL return only products matching the specified category
2. WHEN an invalid category is provided THE SYSTEM SHALL return an empty result set
3. WHEN multiple categories are specified THE SYSTEM SHALL return products matching any of the specified categories

### Requirement 4: Product Search by Brand
**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to search products by brand name, so that I can find all products from a specific manufacturer.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a brand name is provided THE SYSTEM SHALL return all products matching that brand
2. WHEN partial brand names are provided THE SYSTEM SHALL support case-insensitive partial matching
3. WHEN no products match the brand criteria THE SYSTEM SHALL return an empty result set

### Requirement 5: Flexible Schema Support
**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to store products with varying attributes, so that different product types can have their unique specifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a product is stored THE SYSTEM SHALL support flexible JSON schema for product attributes
2. WHEN retrieving products THE SYSTEM SHALL return all stored attributes regardless of schema variations
3. WHEN common attributes are missing THE SYSTEM SHALL handle gracefully without errors

### Requirement 6: Sample Data Management
**User Story:** As a developer, I want sample product data to be available in the system, so that I can test and demonstrate API functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the system is initialized THE SYSTEM SHALL populate the database with representative sample products
2. WHEN sample data is created THE SYSTEM SHALL include products from multiple categories and brands
3. WHEN sample data is accessed THE SYSTEM SHALL demonstrate the flexible schema capabilities

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Validation
**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want clear error messages and proper HTTP status codes, so that I can handle errors appropriately in my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN an error occurs THE SYSTEM SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes (400, 404, 500)
2. WHEN validation fails THE SYSTEM SHALL provide detailed error messages indicating the specific validation issues
3. WHEN system errors occur THE SYSTEM SHALL log errors for debugging while returning user-friendly messages

### Requirement 8: API Performance
**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want fast response times, so that my application can provide a responsive user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN retrieving a single product THE SYSTEM SHALL respond within 200ms under normal load
2. WHEN retrieving product lists THE SYSTEM SHALL support pagination to maintain performance
3. WHEN database queries are executed THE SYSTEM SHALL use efficient query patterns and indexing
